#Database

##Notes
* Should events get there own tree?
  * For:
    * Easier to separate stuff?
  * Against:
    * More complicated to get data needed
* Should monsters be an array, or obect with number as key?
  * Could all monsters be added with isActive flag like I had been doing?
* Figure out how to structure player characters/summons/allies/monsters
